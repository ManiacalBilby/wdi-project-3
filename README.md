# wdi-project-3

### Overview

For my third project I chose to create an app that can be used by disc golf players to save courses and keep an online collection of discs. 

[TreeTime App](https://young-bastion-12479.herokuapp.com "TreeTime")

### Unsolved Problems

The following list are some objectives that I would like to work on next:

* Complete POST, PATCH, and DELETE for discs and courses
* Relocate delete for users to edit user page
* Add note feature to courses
* Display disc information when hovering over a disc
* Refactor code to reduce Axios calls
* Improve overall styling

### What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my grasp on React and React Router. The relationship between Express and React also became clearer when I had to hoist the state of my app and restructure my app.

I work better with more in depth planning. I plan to utilize Trello more heavily on my next project in order to improve how I use my time. 

Coding with others is invaluable. While some of the help I received was direct, there were also times where helping others led me to a solution for one of my own issues.
